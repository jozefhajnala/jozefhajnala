### Hi there

My name is Jozef and I am an actuary turned developer using R, Python, Scala and Spark to implement large scale risk modeling applications in the finance industry. I enjoy ensuring  reproducibility and maintainability by deploying them in an automated and containerized manner using Docker, Kubernetes and automation tools such as Jenkins or Bamboo.
